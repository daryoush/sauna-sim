# sauna-sim ui

This repo is a React app for https://saunasim.com

A pretty neat thing about this app is that the "Scenario Settings" section is dynamically generated from the `https://api.saunasim.com/params` endpoint. So this app could easily be reused for similar simulation projects.

### Development
- `npm run start`

### Deployment
- Push to Github master, Netlify will build

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
